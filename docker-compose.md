- Useful when we want to run application with multiple containers.
- It is basically a file with key value pair, just like json.
- In this file we specify ports and build context, volumes, commands for each service.
- By using this file we won't have to manually run our docker container from command line.
- Using this all the services listed in this file will be built, and start running automatically.
- It will automatically download all the dependencies etc and expose the services on specified ports.
